    "But the matrix above, an example from last lecture is not actually a basis. While all columns are indepenent, it is not invertible because it has two equal rows. Later in this lecture, we will connect the column space with the row space - the row space of this matrix is only 2D since two of the rows are the same. This in fact means that the rank of the column space is also only 2 - the row space tells us somethign about the column space. "
